# WiDS 5.0 – Midterm Checkpoint  
## Building a Traffic Sign Classifier

This repository contains the coding work completed up to the midterm checkpoint
for the WiDS 5.0 project.

## Contents
- **Week 3 Assignment**
  - Implemented basic machine learning concepts in Python as part of the assignment.
- **Week 4 Assignment**
  - Extended the Week 3 work by training and evaluating models for traffic sign classification.

The submissions are provided as Google Colab notebooks (`.ipynb`).
Only assignment-related code has been included; tutorial or follow-along code
from the learning videos has not been added.

## Weeks 1 & 2 (Background)
Weeks 1 and 2 focused on Python basics and machine learning theory.
No separate coding submissions were required during these weeks.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Google Colab
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- Basics of Machine Learning and Neural Networks
